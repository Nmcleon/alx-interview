## Coin Change Problem README

## Overview
The "Change comes from within" project focuses on solving the classic coin change problem using dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The objective is to determine the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges participants to apply their understanding of algorithms to devise efficient and correct solutions.

## Concepts Needed
To successfully complete this project, participants should be familiar with the following concepts:

- **Greedy Algorithms**: Understanding how greedy algorithms work and their suitability for the coin change problem.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Basic principles of dynamic programming, overlapping subproblems, and optimal substructure.
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Analyzing time and space complexity, striving for solutions with lower complexity.
- **Problem-Solving Strategies**: Breaking down problems, iterative vs recursive approaches to dynamic programming.
- **Python Programming**: Manipulating lists, using list comprehensions, implementing functions efficiently.

## Resources
Participants can refer to the following resources to aid them in completing the project:

- **Python Official Documentation**: More Control Flow Tools for loops, if statements.
- **GeeksforGeeks Articles**: Coin Change | DP-7, Greedy Algorithm to find Minimum number of Coins.
- **YouTube Tutorials**: Dynamic Programming - Coin Change Problem for visual and step-by-step explanations.

## Usage
Participants are required to implement the solution in Python adhering to the following requirements:

- All files should be executable and follow the PEP 8 style.
- Use Python 3.4.3 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- The first line of each file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.

## Task Details
- **Task 0: Change comes from within**: Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total amount.
