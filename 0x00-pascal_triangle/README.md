# Pascal's Triangle Implementation

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding fundamental Python concepts, including lists, list comprehensions, functions, loops, conditional statements, recursion (optional), arithmetic operations, indexing and slicing, memory management, error handling (optional), efficiency, and optimization. The ultimate goal is to implement Pascal's Triangle in Python, utilizing a combination of mathematical understanding and programming skills.

## Concepts Covered

### Lists and List Comprehensions

Learn how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists. Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.

### Functions

Understand how to define and call functions. Pass parameters and return values, particularly returning a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.

### Loops

Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences. Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.

### Conditional Statements

Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).

### Recursion (Optional)

While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle. Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.

### Arithmetic Operations

Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.

### Indexing and Slicing

Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.

### Memory Management

Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.

### Error and Exception Handling (Optional)

Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.

### Efficiency and Optimization

Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle. Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.

## Task 0: Pascal's Triangle

Implement the function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal’s Triangle of order `n`. The function returns an empty list if `n <= 0`. The provided example demonstrates the output for `pascal_triangle(5)`.
