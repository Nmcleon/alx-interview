# 0x02-minimum_operations

### Description
Calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a specific number of 'H' characters in a text file using "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.
Returns 0 if achieving n characters is impossible.

### Concepts
Dynamic Programming: Breaks down the problem into simpler subproblems and builds up the solution.
Prime Factorization: Reduces the problem to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.
Code Optimization: Finds the most efficient solution.
Greedy Algorithms: Chooses the best option at each step.
Basic Python Programming: Includes loops, conditionals, and functions.

### Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the main script using Python 3:
```
python3 0-main.py
```

### Usage
The main script `0-main.py` demonstrates the usage of the `minOperations` function. It prints the minimum number of operations required to reach a specified number of 'H' characters. For example:
```
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```
