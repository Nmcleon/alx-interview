# 0. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The challenge is to manipulate the matrix efficiently without creating a copy of the data structure, thereby minimizing space complexity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8.10
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic understanding of 2D matrices and in-place operations

### Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.8.10 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

### Running the Program

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program using the command:
./main_0.py
